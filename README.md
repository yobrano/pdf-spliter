This is a script that splits a single pdf to multiple smaller pdfs. 
It only requires three parameters, 
1. starting page number, 
2. ending page number and 
3. the section name.

The three are provided in a csv file. 
Here is how to use the script.
`python split_from_file.py pdf_file_name.pdf csv_file_name.csv`
